**You**’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Hehe$$\begin{equation}f(x)=\begin{cases}1 & \text{if}\ x\ge 0 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise}\end{cases}\end{equation}$$

$x_1^2$



$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

$$
f(n) = \begin{cases}
1 & if\quad n=1\\
2 & if\quad n\ge1
\end{cases}
$$

$$
\begin{equation}
f(x)=\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if}\ x\ge 0 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
$$

To add new posts, $$x^2+y^2$$simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
